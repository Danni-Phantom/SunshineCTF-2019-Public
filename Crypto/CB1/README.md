This challenge is a mid level crypto challenge, around 100 points, that is part of a series of challenges. It requires us to host a .wav file.

## Solution

Basic 25 character key length Polybius cipher. The key is made in the classic way, by filling in the keyword "clarinet" and then all remaining letters (i/j are treated as the same letter). Then this key can be used to decrypt the ciphertext by hand or with a solver.
