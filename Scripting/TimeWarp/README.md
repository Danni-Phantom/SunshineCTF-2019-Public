# Time Warp
Like "Repetition", but they have to give the number *before* it's given. There are three ways to accomplish this.


Since the number is given even after the user get's it wrong, and since the numbers are the same every time, most people will probably try to "groundhog day" the challenge.

The other solution is that the seed is given secretly in the problem description. Exploiting this known seed is the only (intended) solution to the sequel challenge, Time Warp 2.

The final way is to brute force it. There are only 1000 numbers to choose from each time, and only 150 rounds. Given connection lag, it may take a while, but it's certainly doable, if inelegant.
