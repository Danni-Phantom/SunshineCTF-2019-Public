# SunshineCTF 2019 Challenges

This repo is to be used by challenge authors to host the sources of SunshineCTF 2019 challenges.

## Directory Structure

* Challenge category (e.g. `Web`, `Crypto`, `Pwn`)
    * Challenge (e.g. `MyEasyChallenge`, `ThisIsLiterallyImpossible`)
        * The challenge itself

## Required Files

| File name         | Description
|-------------------|-------------
| `description.md`  | Markdown formatted description as should be displayed to players on the challenge description page.
| `README.md`       | Detailed information including a description of how the challenge works, steps to build and deploy this challenge, how to maintain it, and the intended solution. This will not be given to players.
| `flag.txt`        | The challenge's flag in the format `sun{flag_goes_here}`. If the flag is of a format different than this, please mention this explicitly in your `README.md` file.

If a challenge has files that should be downloadable from the challenge description, create a subdirectory `attachments` and place the files there.

An example challenge is available in [`Misc/Brainmeat`](Misc/brainmeat).

## Submitting a Challenge

When adding a new challenge, please follow these steps:

_Note:_ In this example, the challenge's name is `Hello Friend` and it is a Stego challenge.

1. Fork this repo to your own account by clicking the Fork button at the top-right of the screen (your fork will stay private).
2. Clone your repo locally (`git clone git@github.com:my_github_username/SunshineCTF-2019-Private.git && cd SunshineCTF-2019-Private`)
3. Create a git branch with the name of the challenge (`git checkout -b hello-friend`).
4. Create your challenge directory and the source files.
5. Stage your challenge files to be committed (`git add Stego/Hello-Friend && git status`).
6. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Added Hello Friend challenge'`)
7. Push the branch you created to your fork (`git push -u origin hello-friend`)
8. Back on the GitHub website for your fork, there should be a new button to create a pull request from the `hello-friend` branch on your repo to the upstream repo (the one on HackUCF's GitHub). Click that, fill out the details, and submit your pull request.

## NEW FOR 2019 => Large File Addendum

If the file you are uploading is larger than 1MB, leave a file in it's place named `filename.txt`. Within said file describe the location of the actual file. For example:

```plaintext
MOVIE.mp4

This is the movie for my Sunshine CTF Challenge

It is located at: GOOGLE_DRIVE_LINK_HERE
or at: S3_LINK_HERE
```

If you need help uploading your file to some static location, ask in Slack.
