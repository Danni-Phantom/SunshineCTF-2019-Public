Hey you! You're a hacker, right? So am I! Or, at least I thought I was. You see, I'm a big fan of The Undertaker, and I was trying to help him out. He's got an upcoming Hell in a Cell match against Mankind. I wrote some malware I named Undertaker C2 and infected the computers of Mankind's manager with it. The problem is that I accidentally used an old version of this malware, which was before I tested the code and got the bugs worked out. So none of the functionality seems to work! I also lost the source code for this malware. I'm in a real bind, because I need to get information off of that computer to see what Mankind is planning. Here's the malware implant I placed on his computer, please see if you can use it to retrieve any useful information!
